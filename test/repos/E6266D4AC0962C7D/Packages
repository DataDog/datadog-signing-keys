Description: Datadog Signing Keys
  The datadog-signing-keys package carries currently active public signing
  keys that Datadog uses to sign APT repository metadata and DEB packages.
  Having this package installed makes all the included keys trusted by APT
  and allows for checking package-level signatures by debsig-verify.
  .
  Updating this package regularly will ensure presence of new keys prior
  to key rotations performed by Datadog, eliminating the need to add new
  keys manually.
